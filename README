Adjust IP address for weirne server in index.html

Ensure web server is returning mime-type cache/manifest for cache.manifest. For Apache:
  AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest
  
Check mime type with curl
$ curl -I http://localhost/weinre-offline/cache.manifest
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 22 Mar 2011 00:30:29 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.15 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.15 OpenSSL/0.9.8l DAV/2 PHP/5.3.3
Last-Modified: Tue, 22 Mar 2011 00:14:33 GMT
ETag: "76b6db-19-49f0720ef8c40"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 25
Content-Type: text/cache-manifest

Ensure the offline application is working.  If there is a offline configuration problem, weinre works OK.
  * Load http://192.168.1.123/weinre-offline/index.html
  * Stop apache
  * Ensure page reloads without error

When http://192.168.1.123/weinre-offline/index.html is loaded on an iPad OS 4.3, the client initially shows up in the weinre console but then disappears.
Similar results were seen with Chrome 10.0.648.151 on OS X

Running weinre on a different server than apache did not seem to help

If you make changes to the index.html, you'll need to edit the manifest or empty the browser cache before you can see the changes.

Removing manifest="cache.manifest" from html allows weinre to work. (You might need to delete the browser cache first)
